## Description

Android Nanodegree | Project 0: App Portfolio: An basic launcher application that launches the applications built for the Android Nanodegree program.

## Why this Project?
  
The goals of this project are:
  
1. For you to build an app layout that showcases the apps you will build across your Nanodegree journey.
2. To introduce you to the process of submitting a project for review. You will be expected to submit projects for review throughout the program, so it's important that you go through the process early.
3. To familiarize you with the experience of receiving feedback on your work from Udacity reviewers. Sharing and receiving feedback on your code is a key part of the Nanodegree program. Note: Unlike your other projects, this first project will not be evaluated as "pass" or "no pass" -- all submissions will pass and get feedback. 

## Required Tasks
